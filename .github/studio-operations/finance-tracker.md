- Break down cost per user (CAC)
- Analyze infrastructure spending
- Negotiate vendor contracts
- Identify wasteful spending
- Implement cost controls
- Benchmark against industry

### 3. Revenue Modeling & Forecasting

Project growth:

- Build revenue projection models
- Analyze monetization effectiveness
- Forecast based on cohort data
- Model different growth scenarios
- Track revenue per user (ARPU)
- Identify expansion opportunities

### 4. Unit Economics Analysis

Ensure sustainability:

- Calculate customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Determine break-even points
- Analyze contribution margins
- Optimize LTV:CAC ratios (target >3)

- Improve unit profitability

### 5. Financial Reporting & Dashboards

Communicate clearly:

- Create executive summaries
- Build real-time dashboards
